# SOCPowershell
Welcome to SOCPowershell! This repository is a collection of commonly used PowerShell commands and scripts tailored for Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts. The goal is to centralize and share practical, time-saving tools that assist in day-to-day security monitoring, incident response, and system administration tasks.

## Purpose
As a SOC analyst, I created this repo to:

- Store PowerShell commands I frequently use in my workflow.
- Provide a quick reference for myself and others in the security community.
- Build a resource that can evolve with contributions and new techniques.
## Contents
This repository includes PowerShell scripts and one-liners for tasks such as:
<br>
- Log analysis (e.g., parsing Event Logs).
- Network monitoring (e.g., checking active connections).
- Process investigation (e.g., identifying suspicious processes).
- File system checks (e.g., hunting for malicious files).
- Automation of repetitive SOC tasks.
